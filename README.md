# Migrate and modernize case for Linux and OSS DB to Azure

Terra Firm Laboratories is a global bioengineering company thatâ€™s the leading researcher and innovator in genetic and biological science technology. The company was founded in 1975 with its corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, CA. Their mission-critical workloads are currently hosted in an on-premises datacenter and are beginning a journey to modernize and migrate into the cloud using Microsoft Azure.

The CTO, Dennis Nedry, has kicked off an initiative for the organization to begin adopting the Microsoft Azure cloud and modernize its infrastructure. He has already had his team begin assessing their current environment and what it will take to migrate to the cloud. They are looking to optimize their technology investments by reducing technical debt and streamlining operations using Azure Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) cloud services.

## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will gain experience designing and implementing a strategy for migrating Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and MySQL database workloads to Azure.

At the end of the workshop, you will be better able to design and implement an Azure migration strategy for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and MySQL database workloads using Azure Virtual Machines, and Azure Database for MySQL.

### Whiteboard design session

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn to design a strategy for migrating existing on-premises Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and MySQL database workloads to Azure. Throughout the whiteboard design session, you will look at the virtual machine (VM) pricing and migrating MySQL database workloads to Azure.

At the end of the workshop, you will be better able to design a migration strategy for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) workloads to Azure VMs and MySQL database workloads to Azure Database for MySQL.

Continue to the [Whiteboard design session](Whiteboard%20design%20session) documents folder.

### Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab, you will perform steps to migrate Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and MySQL database workloads to Azure. You will go through provisioning a Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM, and migrate MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to set up a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VM for application migration to Azure and migrate an on-premises MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL.

Continue to the [Hands-on lab](Hands-on%20lab) documents folder.
