# Trainer information

Thank you for taking the time to support the whiteboard design sessions as a trainer!

## Role of the trainer

An amazing trainer:

- Creates a safe environment in which learning can take place.

- Stimulates the participant's thinking.

- Involves the participant in the learning process.

- Manages the learning process (on time, on topic, and adjusting to benefit participants).

- Ensures individual participant accountability.

- Ties it all together for the participant.

- Provides insight and experience to the learning process.

- Effectively leads the whiteboard design session discussion.

- Monitors quality and appropriateness of participant deliverables.

- Effectively leads the feedback process.

## Whiteboard design session flow

Each whiteboard design session uses the following flow:

**Step 1: Review the customer case study (15 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

- Customer's background, situation, needs, and technical requirements

- Current customer infrastructure and architecture

- Potential issues, objectives, and blockers

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

- Determine your target customer audience.

- Determine the customer's business needs to address your solution.

- Design and diagram your solution.

- Prepare to present your solution.

**Step 3: Present the solution (30 minutes)**

**Outcome**

Present solution to your customer:

- Present solution

- Respond to customer objections

- Receive feedback

**Wrap-up (15 minutes)**

- Review preferred solution

## Before the whiteboard design session: How to prepare

Before conducting your first whiteboard design session:

- Read the Student guide (including the case study) and Trainer guide.

- Become familiar with all key points and activities.

- Plan the point you want to stress, which questions you want to drive, transitions, and be ready to answer questions.

- Prior to the whiteboard design session, discuss the case study to pick up more ideas.

- Make notes for later.

## During the whiteboard design session: Tips for an effective whiteboard design session

**Refer to the Trainer guide** to stay on track and observe the timings.

**Do not expect to memorize every detail** of the whiteboard design session.

When participants are doing activities, you can **look ahead to refresh your memory**.

- **Adjust activity and whiteboard design session pace** as needed to allow time for presenting, feedback, and sharing.

- **Add examples, points, and stories** from your own experience. Think about stories you can share that help you make your points clearly and effectively.

- **Consider creating a "parking lot"** to record issues or questions raised that are outside the scope of the whiteboard design session or can be answered later. Decide how you will address these issues, so you can acknowledge them without being derailed by them.

***Have fun**! Encourage participants to have fun and share!*

**Involve your participants.** Talk and share your knowledge but always involve your participants, even while you are the one speaking.

**Ask questions** and get them to share to fully involve your group in the learning process.

**Ask first**, whenever possible. Before launching into a topic, learn your audience's opinions about it and experiences with it. Asking first enables you to assess their level of knowledge and experience, and leaves them more open to what you are presenting.

**Wait for responses**. If you ask a question such as, "What's your experience with (fill in the blank)?" then wait. Do not be afraid of a little silence. If you leap into the silence, your participants will feel you are not serious about involving them and will become passive. Give participants a chance to think, and if no one answers, patiently ask again. You will usually get a response.

# Migrate and modernize case for Linux and OSS DB to Azure whiteboard design session student guide

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this whiteboard design session, you will learn to design a strategy for migrating existing on-premises Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and MySQL database workloads to Azure. Throughout the whiteboard design session, you will look at the virtual machine (VM) pricing and migrating MySQL database workloads to Azure.

At the end of the workshop, you will be better able to design a migration strategy for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) workloads to Azure VMs and MySQL database workloads to Azure Database for MySQL.

## Step 1: Review the customer case study

**Outcome**

Analyze your customer's needs.

Timeframe: 15 minutes

Directions: With all participants in the session, the facilitator/SME presents an overview of the customer case study along with technical tips.

1. Meet your team members and trainer.

2. Read all directions for steps 1-3 in the student guide.

3. As a team, review the following customer case study.

### Customer situation

Terra Firm Laboratories is a global bioengineering company thatâs the leading researcher and innovator in genetic and biological science technology. The company was founded in 1975 with its corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, CA. Their mission-critical workloads are currently hosted in an on-premises datacenter and are beginning a journey to modernize and migrate into the cloud using Microsoft Azure.

The CTO, Dennis Nedry, has kicked off an initiative for the organization to begin adopting the Microsoft Azure cloud and modernize its infrastructure. He has already had his team begin assessing their current environment and what it will take to migrate to the cloud. They are looking to optimize their technology investments by reducing technical debt and streamlining operations using Azure Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud services.

Terra Firm Laboratories has already completed the first round of analysis to identify the applications and workloads to begin migrating first. Out of over 250 workloads they have running on-premises, they have identified one workload that exemplifies multiple components common across many of their other workloads. They decided to use a simpler workload that will still assist in proving out the migration plan as itâs developed. This workload includes Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) servers hosting a Web application that uses a MySQL backend database.

The initial workload to prove the feasibility of the migration process consists of the following:

- Web Application Front End
    - PHP web application hosted using Apache HTTP web server.
    - 2x Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 servers
        - Each with 2 CPU cores and 16 GB memory
- Application Databases
    - MySQL 8
    - 2x server with data replication
        - Each with 4 CPU cores and 32 GB memory
    - Database size: 500 MB

The development standards that Terra Firm has established include DevOps automation to deploy the web application code to the front-end servers. They also use Git for version control for all their development teams.

This initial workload utilizes components that represent those used by most of their workloads throughout the on-premises datacenter. in their on-premises datacenter. They need to start with creating a migration plan around this workload to prove the larger overall strategy that will be implemented. According to Nedry, âItâs really important we have a solid migration plan, as we will be sunsetting our on-premises datacenter in the next 2 to 3 years.â

### Customer needs

1. Migrate existing workloads to Azure as efficiently as possible.

2. Security is extremely important when integrating the on-premises network and workloads with Microsoft Azure.

3. Improve the business continuity and disaster recovery position of the workloads that are migrated to Azure.

### Customer objections

1. What are the options to roll back to the on-premises VMs if the migration fails?

2. What options does Azure provide for utilizing existing Red Hat Subscription to save on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VM cost in the cloud?

3. Securing and monitoring our on-premises workloads is extremely important. What options does Azure offer to extend this into the cloud?

4. What options are there for PaaS hosting in Azure, and would they offer additional cost savings?

### Infographic for common scenarios

## Step 2: Design a proof of concept solution

**Outcome**

Design a solution and prepare to present the solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 60 minutes

**Business needs**

Directions: With your team, answer the following questions and be prepared to present your solution to others:

1. Who will you present this solution to? Who is your target customer audience? Who are the decision makers?

2. What customer business needs do you need to address with your solution?

**Design**

Directions: With your team, respond to the following questions:

*Migration*

1. How will you migrate the on-premises PHP workloads to Azure?

2. How will you migrate the on-premise MySQL database workloads to Azure?

*Pricing*

1. What is the estimated cost for the workloads after being migrated to Azure IaaS?

    Be sure to cover all aspects of the design, including the primary site, disaster recovery (DR) solution, backup solution, and monitoring costs.

    What's the best option for hosting the MySQL database workloads?

    Have you included all appropriate cost-saving measures?

2. What is the estimated cost for the web application workloads if migrated to Azure PaaS?

    Be sure to cover all aspects of the design, including the primary site, disaster recovery (DR) solution, backup solution, and monitoring costs

    How does the cost of PaaS compare to IaaS?

**Prepare**

Directions: As a team:

1. Identify any customer needs that are not addressed with the proposed solution.

2. Identify the benefits of your solution.

3. Determine how you will respond to the customer's objections.

Prepare a 15-minute chalk-talk style presentation to the customer.

## Step 3: Present the solution

**Outcome**

Present a solution to the target customer audience in a 15-minute chalk-talk format.

Timeframe: 30 minutes

**Presentation**

Directions:

1. Pair with another team.

2. One group is the Microsoft team and the other is the customer.

3. The Microsoft team presents their proposed solution to the customer.

4. The customer makes one of the objections from the list of objections.

5. The Microsoft team responds to the objection.

6. The customer team gives feedback to the Microsoft team.

## Wrap-up

- Have participants reconvene with the larger session group to hear the facilitator/SME share the following preferred solution.

## Preferred target audience

- Dennis Nedry, Chief Technology Officer
- Technical Architects
- Infrastructure Architects
- Data Architects

## Preferred solution

Design a migration solution that addresses the needs and requirements of the organization. Provide details of your implementation. Make sure to document your design with a diagram along with addressing the questions.

*High-level architecture*

![The image shows how the on-premises network on the left connects through Azure ExpressRoute to the Hub VNet with Azure Bastion and Azure Firewall. On the right is the Spoke VNet that is connected to the Hub VNet through VNet Peering and hosts the VM and MySQL workloads.](images/PreferredSolutionDiagram.jpg "Preferred solution diagram")

These are the components of the preferred solution diagram:

- Terra Firm Laboratories has a Hub and Spoke networking setup with Azure ExpressRoute connected to Azure.
- The PHP web applications have been migrated to Azure and are running in Azure Virtual Machines hosted within a Spoke VNet in Azure that is peered with the Hub VNet.
- The MySQL database has been migrated to Azure Database for MySQL and is integrated with the Spoke VNet in Azure that is peered with the Hub VNet and is accessible from the web application.
- Each application in Azure is contained within its own Subnet with Network Security Groups securing them accordingly.
- Other components that may be setup up according to the client's security requirements are:
    - Azure Bastion for secure SSH access to Azure VMs
    - Azure Firewall to protect the front-end web applications (a common component to use in a secure Azure networking model)
    - Azure Monitor setup to implement monitoring of Azure VMs

These are some reasons for the chosen options in the preferred solution:

- New Azure VMs for the migrated web application workloads are used since they also need to be upgraded to the latest version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL).
- The MySQL databases are migrated to Azure Database for MySQL so moving the existing MySQL database servers does not apply to this scenario. Also, Azure Database for MySQL provides scalable, fully managed MySQL databases.

*Migration*

1. How will you migrate the on-premises PHP workloads to Azure?

    Since it is recommended to upgrade to the latest version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, it will be necessary to create new servers. In this case, Azure Migrate cannot be used to move the on-premises VMs into Azure as-is. New Azure VMs need to be created with the application workloads deployed to these new Azure VMs.

    Application deployment automation is already being done using DevOps practices within Terra Firm Laboratories, so there should be minimal effort necessary to extend those pipelines to deploy to the new Azure VMs in parallel. This parallel deployment will enable the on-premises and Azure VMs to be deployed simultaneously with the latest source code deployed to both sets of hosting infrastructure. This will simplify the cutover process of redirecting web application traffic to the new Azure VMs. It will also enable a simplified process to roll back in the event of a migration failure.

2. How will you migrate the on-premise MySQL database workloads to Azure?

    The MySQL databases will be migrated to Azure Database for MySQL. The Azure Database for MySQL service will utilize VNet integration to securely connect to the Spoke VNET in the Hub and Spoke network topology.

    The MySQL databases will be migrated using the Azure Database Migration Service to perform a one-time full database migration from the on-premises MySQL databases to Azure Database for MySQL. During the migration process, the on-premises MySQL databases will remain until the cutover to Azure Database for MySQL is verified.

*Pricing*

1. What is the estimated cost for the workloads after being migrated to Azure IaaS?

    Be sure to cover all aspects of the design, including the primary site, disaster recovery (DR) solution, backup solution, and monitoring costs.

    What's the best option for hosting the MySQL database workloads?

    Have you included all appropriate cost-saving measures?

    **Solution**

    Pricing Azure solutions is a complex task. The example solution below includes many assumptions, for example on virtual machine size. These need to be validated with Terra Firm.

    Since Terra Firm and their current on-premises datacenter is in Palo Alto, CA, the nearest Azure Region to use will be West US. Their secondary Azure region for DR will be East US, as that's the Azure region pair for West US.

    The following pricing estimates are for their primary region. There will need to be additional discussions with Terra Firm Laboratories to determine the extent of Disaster Recovery (DR) they require for this initial set of workloads being migrated to Azure.

    _Web application_

    | **Component** | **Region** | **Details / Assumptions** | **Est. Monthly Cost (USD)** |
    |----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
    | Linux Virtual Machines | West US | 2x D4 v5 VMs (4 vCores, 16 GiB RAM) & Red Hat Enterprise Linux | $62.1376 each |

    > **Note:** The D4 v5 VM pricing estimate is for Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB) pricing with 3-year reserved instance. For Pay-as-you-go with AHB the estimated cost would be $163.52 per month for each VM. Reserved instances offer a much lower cost.

    _MySQL databases_

    | **Component** | **Region** | **Details / Assumptions** | **Est. Monthly Cost (USD)** |
    |----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
    | MySQL database | West US | Flexible Server D8 v4 (8 vCores, 32 GiB RAM) | $261.75 |

    > **Note:** The Flexible Server D8 v4 pricing estimate is for a 3-year reserved instance. For Pay-as-you-go the estimated cost would be 569.40 per month. Reserved instances offer a much lower cost. Also, this cost estimate does not include storage or additional IOPS since the total cost of these will vary depending on the database usage.

2. What is the estimated cost for the web application workloads if migrated to Azure PaaS?

    Be sure to cover all aspects of the design, including the primary site, disaster recovery (DR) solution, backup solution, and monitoring costs

    How does the cost of PaaS compare to IaaS?

    **Solution**

    Pricing Azure solutions is a complex task. The example solution below includes many assumptions, for example on Azure App Service pricing tier. These need to be validated with Terra Firm.

    Since Terra Firm and their current on-premises datacenter is in Palo Alto, CA, the nearest Azure Region to use will be West US. Their secondary Azure region for DR will be East US, as that's the Azure region pair for West US.

    The following pricing estimates are for their primary region. There will need to be additional discussions with Terra Firm Laboratories to determine the extent of Disaster Recovery (DR) they require for this initial set of workloads being migrated to Azure.

    _Web application_

    For hosting the PHP web application in Azure using a PaaS service, then Azure App Service is the most appropriate service. App Service offers a fully managed service with built-in infrastructure maintenance, security patching, and scaling. This reduces the cost of maintenance allowing IT Admins more time to work on other tasks instead of maintaining VMs.

    App Service also supports VNet integration enabling integration with the Hub and Spoke networking topology to meet the security requirements of Terra Firm.

    | **Component** | **Region** | **Details / Assumptions** | **Est. Monthly Cost (USD)** |
    |----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
    | Azure App Service Plan | West US | P2v3 (4 vCores, 16 GB RAM) | $295 |

    > **Note:** The P2v3 pricing estimate is for a 3-year reserved instance. For Pay-as-you-go the estimated cost would be $489 per month. Reserved instance offers a much lower cost.

    A comparison of the estimated cost of a single VM to Azure App Service as estimated in the preferred solution shows that PaaS hosting using Azure App Service costs more. However, it's important to remember that with Azure App Service being a fully managed service, the overall maintenance costs for IT Admins will be lower. Further consultation will need to be performed with Terra Firm to determine how much administration time will be saved by hosting on Azure App Service instead of VMs.

    _MySQL databases_

    The preferred solution includes hosting the MySQL databases using Azure Database for MySQL. This is already a PaaS service, so the previous cost estimate remains the same.

## Checklist of preferred objection handling

1. What are the options to roll back to the on-premises VMs if the migration fails?

    The migration process will be designed to create new application deployments to the new Red Hat Enterprise Linux VMs in Azure in parallel to the existing on-premises VMs. This will allow traffic to be cut over to the new VMs when ready.

    In the event of an unexpected issue during migration, the existing on-premises VMs, application deployments, and databases will remain in place as a fallback. If there is an issue detected during the cutover process, the on-premises servers will be able to immediately pick up where they left off.

2. What options does Azure provide for utilizing existing Red Hat Subscription to save on Red Hat enterprise Linux (RHEL) VM cost in the cloud?

    Azure Hybrid Benefit (AHB) for pay-as-you-go virtual machines or virtual machine scale sets (Flexible orchestration mode only) is an optional licensing benefit. It significantly reduces the cost of running Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) virtual machines in the cloud.

    After Azure Hybrid Benefit is applied to a RHEL or SLES virtual machine, you are no longer charged a software fee. Your virtual machine is charged a BYOS (bring your own subscription) fee instead.

3. Securing and monitoring our on-premises workloads is extremely important. What options does Azure offer to extend this into the cloud?

    Microsoft Defender for Cloud is a solution for cloud security posture management (CSPM) and cloud workload protection (CWP) that finds weak spots across your cloud configuration, helps strengthen the overall security posture of your environment, and can protect workloads across multi-cloud and hybrid environments from evolving threats.

    Azure Monitor collects monitoring telemetry from a variety of on-premises and Azure sources. Management tools, such as those in Azure Security Center and Azure Automation, also push log data to Azure Monitor. The service aggregates and stores this telemetry in a log data store thatâs optimized for cost and performance. Analyze data, set up alerts, get end-to-end views of your applications, and use machine learningâdriven insights to quickly identify and resolve problems.

4. What options are there for PaaS hosting in Azure, and would they offer additional cost savings?

    Further evaluation of the applications will be necessary to determine the requirements for hosting these applications using Azure App Service. App Service Web Apps provide a PaaS hosting option for applications that further reduce the management burden over IaaS VMs. It supports applications built with PHP among other development languages, as well as running on a Linux host for the Web App.

    Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is another potential option for hosting applications. For Terra Firm, this may not be the best option as it would likely require a redesign of the applications to host in AKS. If Azure App Service doesn't meet their requirements, then AKS may offer an alternative that fits better.

    If they are willing to redesign their applications, then serverless hosting with Azure Functions could be a consideration. The applications would not be able to be hosted in Azure Functions as they are currently written. This would be applicable to any backend REST APIs they have and not as much to the front-end web applications. The primary benefit of Azure Functions is that it can reduce the amount of source code the development team must write and maintain. Also, given the security requirements of Terra Firm, they would need to use dedicated hosting so it would cost similar to using App Service for hosting the original application.

## Customer quote (to be read back to the attendees at the end)

"We recognized the need and benefits of migrating our aging infrastructure to Azure. I know this migration is going to help us increase reliability while lowering operation and maintenance costs. I'm really looking forward to modernizing with cloud infrastructure that will allow us to do more with less."

-Dennis Nedry, CTO, Terra Firm Laboratories
