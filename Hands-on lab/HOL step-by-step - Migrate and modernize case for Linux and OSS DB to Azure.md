# Migrate and modernize case for Linux and OSS DB to Azure hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will perform steps to migrate Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and MySQL database workloads to Azure. You will go through provisioning a Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM, and migrate MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL.

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will perform steps to migrate Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and MySQL database workloads to Azure. You will go through provisioning a Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM, and migrate MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL.

Terra Firm already has a Hub and Spoke network set up in Azure with Azure Bastion for enabling remote management of Azure VM using Azure Bastion. The Azure resources provisioned throughout this lab will be deployed to this environment.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to set up a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VM for application migration to Azure, and migrate an on-premises MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL.

## Solution architecture

![](../Whiteboard%20design%20session/images/PreferredSolutionDiagram.jpg "Preferred solution diagram")

These are the components of the preferred solution diagram:

- Terra Firm Laboratories has a Hub and Spoke networking setup with Azure ExpressRoute connected to Azure
- The PHP web applications has been migrated to Azure and is running in Azure Virtual Machines hosted within a Spoke VNet in Azure that is peered with the Hub VNet.
- The MySQL database has been migrated to Azure Database for MySQL, and is integrated with the Spoke VNet in Azure that is peered with the Hub VNet and is accessible from the web application.
- Each application in Azure is contained within its own Subnet with Network Security Groups securing them accordingly.
- Other components that may be setup up according to the clients security requirements are:
    - Azure Bastion for secure SSH access to Azure VMs
    - Azure Firewall to protect the front end web applications (a common component to use in a secure Azure networking model)
    - Azure Monitor setup to implement monitoring of Azure VMs

## Requirements

- You must have a working Azure subscription to carry out this hands-on lab step-by-step without a spending cap to deploy the Barracuda firewall from the Azure Marketplace.

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.

To author: remove this section if you do not require environment setup instructions.

## Exercise 1: Create VM to migrate web application

Duration: 45 minutes

In this exercise, you will create a new Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine (VM) that will be the destination for migrating the on-premises Web Application to Azure, and then you will use Azure Bastion to connect to the VM over SSH. Azure Bastion will allow secure remote connections to the VM for Administrators.

### Task 1: Create Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM for application hosting

In this task, you will create a new Red Hat Enterprise Linux virtual machine (VM) that will be the destination for migrating the on-premises Web Application to Azure.

1. Sign in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Ensure that you're using a subscription associated with the same resources you created during the Before the hands-on lab set up.

2. On the **Home** page within the Azure Portal, towards the top, select **Create a resource**.

    ![Create a resource on Azure Portal Home page.](images/2022-11-20-21-08-40.png "Create a resource on Azure Portal Home page.")

3. Within the **Search services and marketplace** field, type **Red Hat Enterprise Linux** and press Enter to search the marketplace, then select **Red Hat Enterprise Linux**.

    ![Red Hat Enterprise Linux is highlighted](images/2022-11-20-21-10-49.png "Red Hat Enterprise Linux is highlighted")

4. Choose **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 (LVM)** then select **Create**.

5. On the **Create a virtual machine** pane, set the following values to configure the new virtual machine:

    - **Resource group**: Select the resource group that you created for this lab. Such as `terrafirm-rg`.
    - **Virtual machine name**: Give the VM a unique name, such as `terrafirm-webapp-vm`.
    - **Region**: Select the Azure Region that was used to create the resource group.
    - **Image**: Verify the image is set to **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.0 (LVM)**.

    ![Create a virtual machine with fields set.](images/2022-11-20-21-15-15.png "Create a virtual machine with fields set.")

6. Set the **Size** field by selecting the **Standard_D4s_v5** virtual machine size.

    ![VM size is set.](images/2022-11-20-21-20-19.png "VM size is set.")

7. Set the **Authentication type** to **Password**, then enter a **Username** and **Password** for the VM administrator account.

    ![Administrator account credentials set.](images/2022-11-20-21-21-51.png "Administrator account credentials set.")

    > **Note**: Be sure to save the Username and Password for the VM, so it can be used later. A recommendation for an easy to remember Username is `demouser` and Password is `demo!pass123`.

8. Select **Next** until you are navigated to the **Networking** tab fo the **Create a virtual machine** page.

    ![Networking tab is selected.](images/2022-11-20-21-26-00.png "Networking tab is selected.")

9. Provision the VM in the Spoke VNet in Azure by selecting the following values under the **Network interface** section:

    - **Virtual network**: Select the Spoke VNet that was created for this lab. Its name will be similar to `terrafirm-spoke-vnet`
    - **Subnet**: `default (10.2.0.0/24)`

    ![Network interface fields set.](images/2022-11-20-21-28-50.png "Network interface fields set.")

10. For the **Public IP**, ensure that a **new** Public IP is selected so a Public IP is provisioned to enable Internet access to the VM. This will be used to access the Web Application over HTTP.

    ![Public IP selected](images/2022-11-20-21-30-21.png "Public IP selected")

11. For the **Select inbound ports**, select the **HTTP (80)** and **SSH (2)** ports to allow both HTTP and SSH traffic through the Network Security Group firewall to reach the VM.

    ![Inbound ports are set](images/2022-11-20-21-32-39.png "Inbound ports are set")

12. Select **Review + create** to review the virtual machine settings.

    ![Review + create button](images/2022-11-20-21-36-24.png "Review + create button")

13. Select **Create** to begin provisioning the virtual machine once the **Validation passed** message is shown.

    ![Validation passed and create button](images/2022-11-20-21-38-48.png "Validation passed and create button")

### Task 2: Install web application

In this task, you will use Azure Bastion to connect to the VM over SSH and install the web application.

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the newly created **Virtual Machine**.

    ![Virtual machine pane is open](images/2022-11-20-21-42-39.png.png "Virtual machine pane is open")

2. On the **Overview** pane of the **Virtual machine** blade, locate and copy the **Public IP Address** for the VM. This will be used to connect to the VM using SSH.

    ![VM Public IP Address](images/2022-11-21-16-45-28.png "VM Public IP Address")

3. At the top of the Azure Portal, select the **Cloud Shell** icon to open up the Azure Cloud Shell.

    ![Cloud Shell icon](images/2022-11-21-16-46-35.png "Cloud Shell icon")

4. Within the **Cloud Shell**, enter the following `ssh` command to connect to the VM using SSH. Be sure to replace the `<ip-address>` placeholder with the **Public IP Address** that was just copied for the VM.

    ```bash
    ssh demouser@<ip-address>
    ```

5. When prompted, enter `y` and press Enter to access the certificate warning for this VM. Then continue by entering the **Password** for the VM.

    ![Cloud Shell with SSH certificate and password prompt](images/2022-11-21-16-49-59.png "Cloud Shell with SSH certificate and password prompt")

    > **Note**: If you followed the previous suggestions for the VM username and password, then the password for the VM will be `demo!pass123`. Otherwise, enter the password you chose when provisioning the VM.

6. Once connected to the VM via SSH, execute the following commands that will download an install script and run it that will install the web application on the VM:

    ```bash
    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/solliancenet/MCW-Migrate-Linux-OSS-DB-to-Azure/lab/Hands-on%20lab/resources/deployment/install-phpipam.sh
    chmod +x install-phpipam.sh
    sudo ./install-phpipam.sh
    ```

7. Once the script completes, open a new browser tab, and navigate to the following URL to test that the web application is installed. Be sure to use `http://` since the web application is not currently configured for TLS/SSL.

    ```
    http://<ip-address>
    ```

8. The web application should currently look similar to the following screenshot. This will indicate the application is installed, but not yet configured for a database. The database still needs to be migrated for the application.

    ![web application in web browser](images/2022-11-21-16-54-27.png "web application in web browser")

## Exercise 2: MySQL database migration

Duration: 60 minutes

In this exercise, you will migrate the on-premises MySQL database for the web application workload to Azure. The Azure Database Migration Service will be used to perform the database migration from the MySQL server on-premises to the Azure Database for MySQL service.
