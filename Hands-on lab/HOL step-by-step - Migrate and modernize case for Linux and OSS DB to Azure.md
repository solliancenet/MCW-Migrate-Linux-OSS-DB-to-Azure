# Migrate and modernize case for Linux and OSS DB to Azure hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will perform steps to migrate Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and MySQL database workloads to Azure. You will go through provisioning a Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM, and migrate MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL.

## Overview

In this hands-on lab, you will perform steps to migrate Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and MySQL database workloads to Azure. You will go through provisioning a Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM, and migrate MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL.

Terra Firm already has a Hub and Spoke network set up in Azure with Azure Bastion for enabling remote management of Azure VM using Azure Bastion. The Azure resources provisioned throughout this lab will be deployed to this environment.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to set up a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VM for application migration to Azure, and migrate an on-premises MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL.

## Solution architecture

![](../Whiteboard%20design%20session/images/PreferredSolutionDiagram.jpg "Preferred solution diagram")

These are the components of the preferred solution diagram:

- Terra Firm Laboratories has a Hub and Spoke networking setup with Azure ExpressRoute connected to Azure
- The PHP web applications has been migrated to Azure and is running in Azure Virtual Machines hosted within a Spoke VNet in Azure that is peered with the Hub VNet.
- The MySQL database has been migrated to Azure Database for MySQL, and is integrated with the Spoke VNet in Azure that is peered with the Hub VNet and is accessible from the web application.
- Each application in Azure is contained within its own Subnet with Network Security Groups securing them accordingly.
- Other components that may be setup up according to the clients security requirements are:
    - Azure Bastion for secure SSH access to Azure VMs
    - Azure Firewall to protect the front end web applications (a common component to use in a secure Azure networking model)
    - Azure Monitor setup to implement monitoring of Azure VMs

## Requirements

- You must have a working Azure subscription to carry out this hands-on lab step-by-step without a spending cap to deploy the Barracuda firewall from the Azure Marketplace.

## Before the hands-on lab

Refer to the Before the hands-on lab setup guide manual before continuing to the lab exercises.
