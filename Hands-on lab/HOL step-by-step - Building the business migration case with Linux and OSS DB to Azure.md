# Building the business migration case with Linux and OSS DB to Azure hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives

In this hands-on lab, you will perform steps to migrate Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and MySQL database workloads to Azure. You will go through provisioning a Red Hat Enterprise Linux VM and migrate MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL.

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will be better able to set up a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) VM for application migration to Azure and migrate an on-premises MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL.

## Overview

Terra Firm Laboratories is a global bioengineering company that’s the leading researcher and innovator in genetic and biological science technology. The company was founded in 1975 with its corporate headquarters in Palo Alto, CA. Their mission-critical workloads are currently hosted in an on-premises datacenter and are beginning a journey to modernize and migrate into the cloud using Microsoft Azure.

The CTO, Dennis Nedry, has kicked off an initiative for the organization to begin adopting the Microsoft Azure cloud and modernize its infrastructure. He has already had his team begin assessing their current environment and what it will take to migrate to the cloud. They are looking to optimize their technology investments by reducing technical debt and streamlining operations using Azure Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud services.

This hands-on lab will guide you through the steps to migrate Terra Firm's initial workload to Azure using RedHat Enterprise Linux and MySQL. They already have a Hub and Spoke network set up in Azure with Azure Bastion for enabling remote management of Azure VM using Azure Bastion. The Azure resources you deploy throughout this lab will be deployed within the existing Hub and Spoke networking environment.

## Solution architecture

![The image shows how the on-premises network on the left connects through Azure ExpressRoute to the Hub VNet with Azure Bastion and Azure Firewall. On the right is the Spoke VNet that is connected to the Hub VNet through VNet Peering and hosts the VM and MySQL workloads.](../Whiteboard%20design%20session/images/PreferredSolutionDiagram.jpg "Preferred solution diagram")

These are the components of the preferred solution diagram:

- Terra Firm Laboratories has a Hub and Spoke networking setup with Azure ExpressRoute connected to Azure. 
- The PHP web applications have been migrated to Azure and are running in Azure Virtual Machines hosted within a Spoke VNet in Azure that is peered with the Hub VNet.
- The MySQL database has been migrated to Azure Database for MySQL and is integrated with the Spoke VNet in Azure that is peered with the Hub VNet and is accessible from the web application.
- Each application in Azure is contained within its own Subnet with Network Security Groups securing them accordingly.
- Other components that may be setup up according to the client's security requirements are:
    - Azure Bastion for secure SSH access to Azure VMs
    - Azure Firewall to protect the front-end web applications (a common component to use in a secure Azure networking model)
    - Azure Monitor setup to implement monitoring of Azure VMs

## Requirements

- You must have a working Azure subscription to carry out this hands-on lab step-by-step.
