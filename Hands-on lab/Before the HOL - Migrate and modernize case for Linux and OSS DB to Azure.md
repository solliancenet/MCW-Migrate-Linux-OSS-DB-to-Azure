# Migrate and modernize case for Linux and OSS DB to Azure before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

- You must have a working Azure subscription to carry out this hands-on lab step-by-step.

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

### Task 1: Create existing resources

In this task, you will leverage a custom Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to deploy the existing Azure resources and a simulated on-premises environment for Terra Firm.

1. Open a browser using "InPrivate" or "Incognito" mode, and navigate to the ARM template: [ARM Template on GitHub](https://github.com/solliancenet/MCW-Migrate-Linux-OSS-DB-to-Azure/tree/lab/Hands-on%20lab/resources/deployment).

2. Select **Deploy to Azure**. This will open a new browser tab to the Azure Portal for custom deployments.

3. If prompted, sign in with an account that is an owner of the Azure Subscription.

4. Fill in the required ARM template parameters.
    - Create a new **Resource group**.
    - Select a **Region**
    - Specify a **Resource Name Base** (specify a base value that includes your initials to keep unique to prevent naming conflicts, for example, `terrafirmcp`).
    - Select **Review + create**

5. Agree to the Terms and conditions and select **Create**.

    The deployment is now underway. On average, this process can take 30 minutes to complete. It is important that you monitor the deployment progress to ensure there are no problems. You can monitor progress by selecting the notification bell in the upper right corner and selecting **Deployment in progress...**

    >**Note**: While automation can make things simpler and repeatable, sometimes it can fail. If at any time during the ARM template deployment there is a failure, review the failure, delete the Resource Group, and try the ARM template again. Review the failures and adjust for errors as appropriate.

    Once the ARM template is deployed, the status will change to complete.

### Task 2: Verify On-Premises Web Application

In this task, you will configure the web application hosted on the simulated on-premises virtual machine that was provisioned by the ARM Template deployment.

1. In the **Azure Portal**, navigate to the **Resource Group** that you created for this lab, then select the **On-premises Workload VM** named similar to `terrafirm-onprem-workload-vm`.

    ![Resource group with on-premises workload VM highlighted](images/2022-11-21-22-49-18.png "Resource group with on-premises workload VM highlighted")

2. On the **Virtual Machine** blade, locate and copy the **Public IP Address** for the VM.

    ![Virtual machine blade with Public IP Address highlighted](images/2022-11-21-22-51-34.png "Virtual machine blade with Public IP Address highlighted")

3. Open a new browser window, then navigate to the following `http://` URL to access the simulated on-premises web application provisioned for this lab. Be sure to replace the `<ip-address>` placeholder with the **Public IP Address** for the VM.

    ```
    http://<ip-address>
    ```

    > **Note**: If you get an error loading the web application, instead of a login page, then there was an error in provisioning. The easiest workaround is to delete the resource group and run the template deployment again.

4. When the web application loads, you may enter the following credentials to login.

    - **Username**: `Admin`
    - **Password**: `ipamadmin`

    ![Login page](images/2022-11-21-22-54-53.png "Login page")

    > **Note**: The first time you login to the web application, it will prompt you to change the Admin password. A recommended password to change it to is `demo!pass123` so it's easily remembered for the lab.

At this point, things are ready for you to go through the Hands-on lab.

You should follow all steps provided *before* performing the Hands-on lab.
