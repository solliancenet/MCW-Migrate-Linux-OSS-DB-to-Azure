## Notes

- This directory contains both a ARM Template (`deploy.json`) file and Azure Bicep (`deploy.bicep`) file for automating the deployment of the Before the HOL resources necessary for the Hands-on lab.

- When authoring these scripts the infrastructure deployment was authored in Azure Bicep first within the `deploy.bicep` file, and then the Azure Bicep CLI `./bicep build` command was used to build the matching ARM Template.
